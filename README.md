# tune

Control iTunes from the command line

This is an experiment on `ncurses`, `ScriptingBridge`, and `Swift`.

The current version is a reimplementation of the old tune I wrote ages ago, which had a direct launch argument API. Now it uses `ncurses` for a pretty text-based UI.

You can see the evolution of tune through [some asciicasts I've recorded in asciinema](https://asciinema.org/~brunophilipe).

### Compiling

1. Clone or download this repo
2. Run `cd tune`
2. Run `make`
3. Run `./build/Release/tune`

You can run the following command to add tune to your run path without moving any file. And then when you compile a new version, the link will automatically point to the new binary:

```
ln -s $(pwd)/build/Release/tune /usr/local/bin/tune
```

### Compatibility

This software is only supported on macOS, since `ScriptingBridge` is not available outside of it.

### To-Do

* **Other media players**

It would be nice to make tune support other media players, such as Spotify. The application uses a generic protocol-based entities to pass 
info back-and-forth between the UI and the control layer, so adding some other players shouldn't be too complicated.
