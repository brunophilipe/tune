# tune

Control iTunes from the command line

This is an experiment on `ncurses`, `ScriptingBridge`, and `Swift`.

The current version is a reimplementation of the old tune which had a direct launch argument API. Now it uses `ncurses` for a pretty text-based UI.

### Compiling

1. Clone or download this repo
2. Run `make`
3. run `./build/tune`

You can run the following command to add tune to your run path without moving any file. And then when you compile a new version, the link will automatically point to the new binary:

```
ln -s $(pwd)/build/Release/tune /usr/local/bin/tune
```

### Compatibility

This software os only supported on macOS, since `ScriptingBridge` is not available outside of it.

### To-Do

* **Other media players**

It would be nice to make tune support other media players, such as Spotify. If that's to be implemented, there needs to be a refactor of the media information objects first: The `iTunesTrack`, `iTunesPlaylist` and other iTunes-coupled types need to be wrapped in generic protocols that can be reused for other software APIs.
